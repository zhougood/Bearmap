# Bearmaps 
This is a mini google map project from cs61b of Berkeley. It used spark as the web frame and some data structure to achieve this map, such as trie for prefix match search, A* for the shortest path search and 2-d tree to find the nearest point to the map node.

You can just to run mapserver.java to start this project in your browser.
